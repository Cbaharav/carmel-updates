This section is taken directly from the link above.

Helita is a Python library for solar physics focused on interfacing with code and projects from the `Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics <http://astro.uio.no>`_ (ITA) at the `University of Oslo <https://www.uio.no>`_. The name comes from Helios + ITA.

Currently, the library is a loose collection of different scripts and classes with varying degrees of portability and usefulness.

Pre-requisites
==============
To make use of helita **you need a Fortran compiler** (`GFortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ is recommended), because some modules are compiled from Fortran. In addition, before attempting to install helita you need the following:

* `Python (2.7.x, 3.4.x or later) <https://www.python.org>`_
* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_

In addition, the following packages are also recommended to take advantage of all the features:

* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
* `h5py <http://www.h5py.org>`_
* `netCDF4 <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_
* `Cython <http://cython.org>`_
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_
* `beautifulsoup4 <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_

Helita will install without the above packages, but functionality will be limited.

All of the above packages are available through Anaconda, and that is the recommended way of setting up your Python distribution.

Cloning git repository
======================
The easiest way is to use git to clone the repository. To grab the latest version of helita and install it::

	$ git clone https://github.com/ITA-solar/helita.git
	$ cd helita
	$ python setup.py install
  

Non-root install
================
If you don't have write permission to your Python packages directory, use the following option with setup.py::

	$ python setup.py install --user

This will install helita under your home directory (typically ~/.local)

Developer install
=================
If you want to install helita but also actively change the code or contribute to its development, it is recommended that you do a developer install instead::

	$ python setup.py develop

This will set up the package, such as the source files used, from the git repository that you cloned (only a link to it is placed on the Python packages directory). Can also be combined with the *-user* flag for local installs::

	$ python setup.py develop --user

Installing with different C or Fortran compilers
================================================
The procedure above will compile the C and Fortran modules using the default gcc/gfortran compilers. It will fail if these are not available in the system. If you want to use a different compiler, please use *setup.py* with the *-compiler=xxx* and/or *-fcompiler=yyy* options, where *xxx*, *yyy* are C and Fortran compiler families (names depend on system). To check which Fortran compilers are available in your system, you can run::

	$ python setup.py build --help-fcompiler

and to check which C compilers are available::

	$ python setup.py build --help-compiler
