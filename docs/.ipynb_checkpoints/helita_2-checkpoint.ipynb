    "Helita is a Python library for solar physics focused on interfacing with code and projects from the `Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics <http://astro.uio.no>`_ (ITA) at the `University of Oslo <https://www.uio.no>`_. The name comes from Helios + ITA. Currently, the library is a loose collection of different scripts and classes with varying degrees of portability and usefulness.\n",

    "Installation\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-requisites\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "To make use of helita **you need a Fortran compiler** (`GFortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ is recommended), because some modules are compiled from Fortran. Before attempting to install helita, you also need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Python (2.7.x, 3.4.x or later) <https://www.python.org>`_\n",
    "* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_\n",
    "* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_\n",
    "* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the following packages are recommended to take advantage of all the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_\n",
    "* `h5py <http://www.h5py.org>`_\n",
    "* `netCDF4 <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_\n",
    "* `Cython <http://cython.org>`_\n",
    "* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_\n",
    "* `beautifulsoup4 <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_\n",
    "\n",
    "Helita will install without the above packages, but functionality will be limited. All of these packages are available through Anaconda, and that is the recommended way of setting up your Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning git repository\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "The easiest way is to use git to clone the repository. To grab the latest version of helita and install it::\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ git clone https://github.com/ITA-solar/helita.git\n",
    "\t$ cd helita\n",
    "\t$ python setup.py install\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    ".. Note::\n",
    "\tThe majority of the most updated versions of bifrost.py, ebysus.py, and all things bifrost related are in the https://github.com/jumasy/helita.git fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-root install\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "If you don't have write permission to your Python packages directory, use the following option with setup.py::\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ python setup.py install --user\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install helita under your home directory (typically ~/.local)\n",
    "\n",
    "Developer install\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "If you want to install helita but also actively change the code or contribute to its development, it is recommended that you do a developer install instead::\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ python setup.py develop\n",
    "\n",
    "This will set up the package, such as the source files used, from the git repository that you cloned (only a link to it is placed on the Python packages directory). Can also be combined with the *-user* flag for local installs::\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ python setup.py develop --user\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing with different C or Fortran compilers\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "The procedure above will compile the C and Fortran modules using the default gcc/gfortran compilers. It will fail if these are not available in the system. If you want to use a different compiler, please use *setup.py* with the *-compiler=xxx* and/or *-fcompiler=yyy* options, where *xxx*, *yyy* are C and Fortran compiler families (names depend on system). To check which Fortran compilers are available in your system, you can run::\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ python setup.py build --help-fcompiler\n",
    "\n",
    "and to check which C compilers are available::\n",
    "\n",

    "BifrostData Class\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "bifrost.py includes the BifrostData class (among others). The following allows to create the class for snapshot number 430 from simulation 'cb10f' from directory '/net/opal/Volumes/Amnesia/mpi3drun/Granflux'::\n",

    "get_var and get_varTime can be used to read variables as well as to calculate quantities (with a call to _get_quantity). iix, iiy, and iiz can be specified to slice the return array (they can be ints, arrays, or lists). If iix, iiy, or iiz is not specified, get_var will read all the numerical domain along the x, y, or z axis, respectively. If no snapshot is specified, the current snap value will be used (either the initialized one, which is the first in the series, or the most recent snap used in set_snap or in a call to get_var).

    "Several of the class's parameters can be found in the dictionary *params*. This dictionary contains information about time (t and dt) and the axes (dx, dy, dz) among other things.
