# The Intern Files

At this point you may be slightly overwhelmed, confused, excited, or all of the above. This is meant to hopefully help in getting you started, and can be updated for future generations of interns.

## Installations

Setting up software, paths, environments, etc. is inherently a fairly time-consuming and frustrating process. Good luck!

**Anaconda-Navigator & Jupyter Notebook:** </br>
Jupyter Notebook is a very useful, commonly used application in which you can easily run your code (especially useful for plotting and images).
You will likely use it frequently in the beginning of your internship and later on as a good starting place for new ideas.
